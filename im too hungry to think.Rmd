## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring:

1. pay
2. help
3. sleep

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

![please let me sleep](https://i.redd.it/bov6xp979tz21.jpg)
```{r ahahhahah, echo=TRUE}
print="i think imma jump instantly if this shit doesnt finish itself bitch"
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
